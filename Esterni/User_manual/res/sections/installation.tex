\section{Product installation and setup}
  \subsection{Requirements}
    In this section all of the basic requirements needed to run and test the product are described.
    \subsubsection{Hardware requirements}
      \begin{itemize}
      	\item \textbf{Internet connection}: for the interaction with the Ethereum blockchain and the AWS services.
      \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{Software requirements}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Node.js:} version 12.0.0 or higher. Download and install the latest version from the \href{https://nodejs.org/it/download/}{Node official site};
        \item \textbf{npm (Node Package Manager):} comes with the Node installation, version 6.10.0 or higher is required;
        \item \textbf{Git:} a working version of git, \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git}{How to install Git}.
      \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{General requirements}
      In order to interact with the Ethereum network an Ethereum account is needed. The account needs to have a positive balance so that functionality costs can be covered. Etherless allows the creation of a wallet on the run, but it does not contain any Ethers.
  \subsection{Installation}
    The following instructions are to be intended for use on a unix-based system (instructions for use on different systems will be added in the future).
    \subsubsection{Download the application}
      A copy of Etherless-cli can be downloaded from out github repository. Follow the following steps to set up the application:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item download a zip of the repository from \href{https://github.com/RoundaboutTeam/etherless-cli/tree/master}{Etherless-cli}, as shown in the image below;

        \item unzip the files in a directory of your choosing;
        \item open a terminal as administrator and move to the chosen directory, where you unzipped the files;
        \item install the dependencies through \texttt{npm install};
        \item run the command \texttt{npm link} to make the \texttt{etherless} commands available.
      \end{itemize}
      \textbf{Note:} we are working towards a more streamlined installation process.
