\section{Product installation and setup}
  \subsection{Requirements}
    In this section all of the basic requirements needed to run and test the product are described.
    \subsubsection{Hardware requirements}
      \begin{itemize}
      	\item \textbf{Internet connection}: in order to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the AWS services.
      \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{Software requirements}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Node:} version 12.0.0 or higher. Download and install the latest version from the \href{https://nodejs.org/it/download/}{Node official site};
        \item \textbf{npm (Node Package Manager):} comes with the Node installation, you'll need version 6.10.0 or higher;
        \item \textbf{Git:} a working version of git, \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git}{How to install Git}.
      \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{General requirements}
      The application interacts with the Ethereum network, in order to be able to do that an Ethereum account is needed. The account also needs to have a positive balance so that functionality costs can be covered. Etherless allows the creation of a wallet on the run, but it does not contain any Ethers.
  \subsection{Installation}
    The following instructions are to be intended for use on a unix-based system (instructions for use on different systems will be added in the future).
    \subsubsection{Download the application}
