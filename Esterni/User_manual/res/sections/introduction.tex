\section{Introduction}
This document is the user manual for Etherless, developed by Roundabout.
\subsection{What is \textit{Etherless}}
Etherless is a Cloud Application Platform which allows developers to deploy Javascript functions in the cloud and let pay final users for their execution , by leveraging the \textit{Ethereum}'s smart contract technology.\\
The platform is managed and maintained by the Administrators.
Developers can deploy Javascript functions into the platform. Users, finally, can run those functions provided they pay the fees set by the developers. Such fees are partially held by the platform itself as a compensation for the expenditure of the actual function execution.\\
Etherless is built integrating the two aforementioned technologies, \textit{Ethereum} and Serverless. \textit{Ethereum} will be responsible for the payments and triggering the invocation of the functions. Serverless will be responsible for the execution of the functions. A command line interface will be the bridge for actual usage for developers and users. The communication between \textit{Ethereum} and Serverless will be achieved instead by listening and emitting \textit{Ethereum} events.
