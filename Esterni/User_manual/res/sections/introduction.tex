\section{Introduction}
This document is the User Manual for \textit{Etherless}, developed by the team \textit{Roundabout}.
\subsection{What is Etherless}
\textit{Etherless} is a Cloud$_{G}$ Application Platform which allows developers to deploy Javascript functions in the cloud$_{G}$ and let final users pay for their execution by leveraging the \textit{Ethereum$_{G}$} smart contract$_{G}$ technology.\\
Developers can deploy Javascript functions into the platform and users can run these functions provided they pay the fees set by the developers. Such fees are partially held by the platform itself as a compensation for the expenditure of the actual function execution. A command line interface will be the bridge for actual usage for both developers and users. The platform is managed and maintained by its administrators.\\
\textit{Etherless} is built integrating two technologies, Ethereum$_{G}$ and Serverless$_{G}$. The Ethereum$_{G}$ blockchain$_{G}$ manages the payments and triggers the invocation of the functions, while Serverless$_{G}$ is responsible for their execution. The communication between Ethereum$_{G}$ and Serverless$_{G}$ will be achieved by emitting and listening to Ethereum$_{G}$ events.

\subsection{Glossary}
