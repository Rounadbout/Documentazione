\section{Introduction}
This document is the user manual for \textit{Etherless}, developed by \textit{Roundabout}.
\subsection{What is Etherless}
\textit{Etherless} is a Cloud Application Platform which allows developers to deploy Javascript functions in the cloud and let pay final users for their execution, by leveraging the \textit{Ethereum}'s smart contract technology.\\
The platform is managed and maintained by the Administrators.
Developers can deploy Javascript functions into the platform. Users, finally, can run those functions provided they pay the fees set by the developers. Such fees are partially held by the platform itself as a compensation for the expenditure of the actual function execution.\\
\textit{Etherless} is built integrating the two aforementioned technologies, Ethereum and Serverless. The Ethereum blockchain manages the payments and triggers the invocation of the functions. Serverless is responsible for the execution of the functions. A command line interface will be the bridge for actual usage for developers and users. The communication between Ethereum and Serverless will be achieved instead by listening and emitting Ethereum events.

\subsection{Glossary}
