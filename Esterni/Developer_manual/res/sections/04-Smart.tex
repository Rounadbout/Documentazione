\section{Etherless-Smart}
	
\subsection{Overview}
	Etherless-smart is the module which handles the blockchain side of things. It consists of a set of Ethereum smart contracts that handle the communication between Etherless-cli and Etherless-server as well as the payment of this work using ETH currency.
	
\subsection{Architecture} % Descrizione dell'architettura utilizzata, compresi i design pattern
		Our goals when developing Etherless-smart were upgradeability and extensibility. For these reasons said module consists of three smart contracts:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{EtherlessSmart:} is the main contract which serves as the middleman between Etherless-cli and Etherless-server. Each one of its methods is either invoked by Etherless-cli to send the requests or by Etherless-server to transmit the responses;
			\item \textbf{EtherlessStorage:} is the storage contract. It stores all relevant information regarding the Javascript functions which can be called when using \textit{Etherless}. Moreover, it contains some utility methods to perform useful operations on this data;
			\item \textbf{EtherlessEscrow:} is the contract which manages everything in regards to monetary transactions. It contains details of every pending transaction and its methods have been implemented to manage an escrow payment.
		\end{itemize}
