	\subsection{Architecture} % Descrizione dell'architettura utilizzata tra i tre moduli cli, smart e server
	This section describes the overall architecture of \textit{Etherless}. \\
	\textit{Etherless} was developed as a layered architecture consisting of three layers, which are also its main components:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Etherless-cli};
		\item \textbf{Etherless-smart};
		\item \textbf{Etherless-server}.
	\end{itemize}
	Each one of these layers has a specific role and responsibility in managing users' requests, and only interacts with the layer directly below it.

	\paragraph{} The product's modules, each one representing a layer, also have a one-way dependency towards the next module.

	\subsection{Communication} % Descrizione della comunicazione dei tre moduli, per le diverse funzionalit√†
	Following the layered architecture pattern, the users' requests received by Etherless-cli move from one layer to the layer right below it. Which means that every module has a specific role in the communication:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Etherless-cli}: accepts users' requests, routes them to Etherless-smart and displays information to the user;
		\item \textbf{Etherless-smart}: processes the received requests and forwards them to Etherless-server if needed. Also returns the requests results to Etherless-cli, once they have been completed;
		\item \textbf{Etherless-server}: interacts with AWS Lambda$_{G}$ and other services in order to satisfy the received requests.
	\end{itemize}

	\end{figure}
	Not all types of requests trigger the communication between all three modules. Some types of requests that do not need an interaction with AWS Lambda$_{G}$ itself will be single-handedly completed by Etherless-smart.

	\subsection{Extensions} %Possibili sviluppi futuri
	The architecture was developed following the SOLID open-close principle, allowing the integration of new functionalities and components inside each module without heavy alteration to the existing code. An in-depth description of the possible extensions is later presented in each module-specific section.
