\section{Introduction}

	\subsection{Purpose of the document}
	The content of this manual is intended to help the developers who decide to maintain or to further develop \textit{Etherless}. \\
	It also describes the requirements necessary to be able to use it, as well as the libraries and external frameworks adopted for the development of the application.


	\subsection{Purpose of the product}
	\textit{Etherless} is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy Javascript$_{G}$ functions and manages the payment for their execution through the Ethereum network.
	The final product involves the integration of two technologies, Serverless$_{G}$ and Ethereum.\\
	Serverless$_{G}$ takes care of the deployment of the functions provided by the developers, which are saved and executed in an external cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services.\\
	The request to use a function and the subsequent payment are instead managed through the Ethereum network using smart contracts. Payment is made in ETH, a significant percentage of which is reserved for service administrators.\\
	The developer and the end user interact with the product through a CLI which provides some intuitive commands.


	\subsection{Glossary}
	A series of technical terms followed by their description are included in the appendix of this document, called the Glossary. The purpose of such appendix is to avoid ambiguity among readers not belonging to the \textit{Roundabout} team.\\
	All the words included in the Glossary have been marked by the letter 'G' written as subscript throughout the whole document.
