	\subsection{Purpose of the document}
	The contents of this manual are intended to help the developers who decide to maintain or further develop Etherless. \\
	It also describes the requirements necessary to be able to use it, the libraries and external frameworks adopted for the development of the application.
	
	
	\subsection{Purpose of the product}
	Etherless is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy Javascript functions and manages the payment for their execution through the Ethereum platform.
	The final product involves the integration of two technologies, Serverless and Ethereum.\\
	Serverless takes care of the deployment of the functions provided by the developers, which are saved and executed in an external cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services.\\
	The request to use a function and the subsequent payment are instead managed through the Ethereum platform using smart contracts. Payment is made in ETH, and a significant percentage of the latter is reserved for service administrators.\\
	The developer and the end user interact with the product through a CLI which provides some intuitive commands.

	
	\subsection{Glossary}
