\subsection{Requirements}
In this section all of the basic requirements needed to run and test the product are described.
\subsubsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Internet connection}: in order to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the AWS services.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AWS credentials}: in order to interact the Amazon Web Services, an AWS account is required.
	\item \textbf{ETH wallet}: in order to perform transactions on the blockchain Ethereum, a \textit{non empty} ETH wallet is required. Etherless allows the creation of a wallet on the run, but it does not contain any Ethers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Setup}
This section describes all the steps needed to install the Etherless product.
\subsubsection{Git}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Windows}: download the .exe file from \href{https://git-scm.com/download/win}{Git official site}, and follow the given instruction;
	\item \textbf{Linux}: open a shell and type: \texttt{sudo apt install git}.
\end{itemize}
	For information on how to install Git on different OS, follow the official guide on: \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git}{How to install Git}.
\subsubsection{Node}
	Download the executable file of the latest version, from \href{https://nodejs.org/it/download/}{Node official site} and follow the given instruction to install. This will also install Node package manager.
\subsubsection{Ganache}
	Ganache is available in two variants CLI or GUI, refer the \href{https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart}{Ganache official web page} for the installation and usage;
\subsubsection{Truffle}
 In order to install Truffle you need to run \texttt{npm install truffle -g}, the minimum version required is the 4.0.0;
\subsection{Configuration}
This section shows how to configure the work environment, to be able to execute, test and develop on Etherless. This configuration steps should be followed in the given order.
\subsubsection{Cloning the repository}
To download the software product on your machine, from the GitHub Etherless repository, you should open a shell and position on the folder you want the software to be located. Then you should use the command \texttt{git clone https://github.com/RoundaboutTeam/etherless.git} and position on the \texttt{master} branch.
\subsubsection{Installing the dependencies}
To install all the packages and libreries needed to work with Etherless you should open a shell and position on the main directory of the software. Then you should run the \texttt{npm install} command, which will take care of installing all the dependencies specified in the \texttt{package.json} file.
\subsubsection{AWS and Ethereum configurations}
In the cloned repository two configuration files are not present for security reasons, since they contain the Ethereum and AWS credentials used to interact with these two services. They are present on the Etherless-server version already uploaded and active on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Any developer who might want to work with a local version of Etherless-server should create an \texttt{AWSconfig.json} file structured as:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{ \\
	\{\\
		"awsKey": <<insert AWS key>>, \\
		"awsSecretKey": <<insert AWS secret key>>, \\
		"awsRegion": <<insert AWS region>> \\
	\}\\
}
\end{quote}
While, to interact with the contract on the blockchain, a \texttt{smartConfig.json} file should be created by the developer, with this structure:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{ \\
	\{\\
	"walletAddress": <<insert wallet address>>, \\
	"privateKey": <<insert private key>>, \\
	"contractAddress": <<insert contract address>>, \\
	"networkName": <<insert network name>> \\
	\}\\
}
\end{quote}
The quoted parameters should be replaced with the actual credentials, and both files moved to \texttt{Config} directory inside Etherless-server.
\subsubsection{Enable \texttt{etherless} commands}
\subsubsection{Truffle suite configuration}
	In order to interact with Ropsten testnet, before beginning the installation process you need two keys: an Infura project id (from your own infura account) and the mnemonic phrase of your Ethereum account. Having these credentials you need to edit the \textit{ruffle-config.js} file, replacing the matching fields at the top with your own. Now you are ready to interact with the Ropsten test network directly from Truffle.\\
	To interact only with a ganache-cli local blockchain no further configuration is needed, as the information is already stored in the \textit{ruffle-config.js} file.

\subsubsection{Etherless-smart}
It is possible to test Etherless-smart module, by launching the \texttt{truffle test} command inside the module's directory.
