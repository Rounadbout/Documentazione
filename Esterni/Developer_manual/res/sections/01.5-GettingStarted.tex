\subsection{Requirements}
This section describes all of the basic requirements needed to run and test the product.
\subsubsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Internet connection}: needed in order to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and AWS services.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AWS credentials}: in order to interact with Amazon Web Services, an AWS account is required;
	\item \textbf{ETH wallet}: in order to perform transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, a \textit{non empty} ETH wallet is required. With \textit{Etherless} the user can create a wallet on the run, but it does not contain any ETH.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Setup}
This section describes all the steps needed to install \textit{Etherless}.
\subsubsection{Git}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Windows}: download the .exe file from the \href{https://git-scm.com/download/win}{Git official website} and follow the given instructions;
	\item \textbf{Linux}: open a shell and type: \texttt{sudo apt install git}.
\end{itemize}
	For information on how to install Git on different OS, follow the official guide on: \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git}{How to install Git}.
\subsubsection{Node}
	Download the the latest version of the executable file from the \href{https://nodejs.org/it/download/}{Node official website} and follow the given instructions. This will also install Node package manager.
\subsubsection{Ganache}
	Ganache is available in two variants, CLI and GUI. Refer to the \href{https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart}{Ganache official website} for installation and usage.
\subsubsection{Truffle}
 In order to install Truffle you need to run \texttt{npm install truffle -g} from your terminal window. The minimum version required is 4.0.0.
\subsection{Configuration}
This section shows how to configure the work environment to be able to execute, test and develop on \textit{Etherless}. These configuration steps should be followed in the given order.
\subsubsection{Cloning the repository}
To download the software product on your machine you should open a shell and change to the location you want the software to be in. Then you should use the command \texttt{git clone https://github.com/RoundaboutTeam/etherless.git} and switch to the \texttt{master} branch.
\subsubsection{Installing the dependencies}
To install all the packages and libraries needed to work with \textit{Etherless} you should open a shell and change to the main directory. Then you should run the command \texttt{npm install}, which will take care of installing all the dependencies specified in the \texttt{package.json} file.
\subsubsection{AWS and Ethereum configurations}
The files containing Ethereum and AWS credentials used to interact with the corresponding services are not included in the cloned repository for security reasons. These are present on the Etherless-server version already uploaded and are active on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Any developer who might want to work with a local version of Etherless-server should create an \texttt{AWSconfig.json} file structured as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{ \\
	\{\\
		"awsKey": <<insert AWS key>>, \\
		"awsSecretKey": <<insert AWS secret key>>, \\
		"awsRegion": <<insert AWS region>> \\
	\}\\
}
\end{quote}
To interact with the contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, a \texttt{smartConfig.json} file should be created with the following structure:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{ \\
	\{\\
	"walletAddress": <<insert wallet address>>, \\
	"privateKey": <<insert private key>>, \\
	"contractAddress": <<insert contract address>>, \\
	"networkName": <<insert network name>> \\
	\}\\
}
\end{quote}
The parameters within angular brackets should be replaced with the actual credentials and both files be moved to the \texttt{Config} directory inside Etherless-server.
\subsubsection{Enable \texttt{etherless} commands}
To enable using commands with the keyword \texttt{etherless} you should open a shell and change to the main directory. Then you should run the command \texttt{npm link} as Administrator.
\subsubsection{Truffle Suite Configuration}
	In order to interact with the Ropsten testnet, before beginning the installation process you need two keys: an Infura project id (from your own Infura account) and the mnemonic phrase of your Ethereum account. Having these credentials you need to edit the \textit{truffle-config.js} file, replacing the matching fields at the top with your own. Now you are ready to interact with the Ropsten test network directly from Truffle.\\
	To interact only with a Ganache-cli local blockchain no further configuration is needed, as the information is already stored in the \textit{truffle-config.js} file.
